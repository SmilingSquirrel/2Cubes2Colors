# 2Cubes2Colors
A non-competing BGMC36 entry.

Blender Version: UPBGE 2.5


The game is rather difficult as I didn't have time to do any fine tuning.
Goal: Collect coins and dodge the traps to get a high score.


Controls:
  Q - Switch cubes.
  Space - Jump.
  
(A word of warning! I have found the 2 color scheme to be painfull on the eyes and ran out of time to try to fix it!)
